# Test Driven Development

"The tougher the programming problem, the less ground that each test
should cover"

The TDD workflow can be summarised as follows:

1.  Quickly add a test
2.  Run all tests and see the new one fail
3.  Make a little change
4.  Run all tests and see them all succeed
5.  Refactor to remove duplication
