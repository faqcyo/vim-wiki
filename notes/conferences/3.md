# Layers

## Entities / Enterprise Business Rules

This first layer is for entities that are going to use our microservices defined in other layers. For example, if we are developing for a shop, our entities could be order, customer, product.

## Use Cases / Application Business Rules

Interactions between entities. For example, customer places an order (from our previous example).

## Interface Adapters

Isolates the use cases from the tools that we use.

## Frameworks & Drivers

Here goes all the frameworks and drivers that we are using for building our application. For example expressjs and MongoDB.

# Dependencies

The flow of dependency goes like this:

`Frameworks -> Adapters -> Use Cases -> Entities`

It only goes in this direction. So use case can't depend on an adapter, but an adapter can depend on a use case.
