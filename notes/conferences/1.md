Try to find unkeyed inputs with different requests. Between the possible unkeyed inputs, we can find the query parameters, as well as the URL port.

Figure out whether the response reflects whatever your unkeyed inputs are, and whether it caches it. If all of this happens, you might have just found a DoS attack.

To find unkeyed queries, put some nonsense payloads in:
1. The query parameter
2. The Accept-Encoding header
3. The Accept header
4. The cookie header
5. The Origin Header

Some hosts take the origin header as a cache key by default, e.g. cloudflare.
