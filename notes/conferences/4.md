# Implementing Dependency Inversion

What we want to do is communicate a use case which resides on the use cases layer, with a database. But our use cases can only depend directly on the entities. If we add a database implementation to our use case, they're going to become tightly coupled, which implies a violation of the dependency injection principle in the clean architecture.

To solve this, what we can do is abstract the database.

1. Each use case needs to define its dependencies as parameters. `module.exports = (StudentRepository, CRMServices) => {}`
2. For each of the services, define what they need to do. That is, define an interface.

# Construction steps

1. Start by defining the entities
2. Figure out, for each entity, what will be their use cases
3. Develop the interface for the framework you want to use (if any)
4. Using dependency injection, add a parameter on the use case constructor to inject the repository / implementation of the interface.
5. On the controller,
