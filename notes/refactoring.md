# Refactoring

Refactoring changes the programs in small steps, so it is easier to find
where a bug is if you made a mistake.

Every time that i refactor the program, i should test if it still work
to discard some mistake.

compile-test-commit --- repeat everytime, with small changes

<span id="Simple"></span>**Simple** and <span
id="self-explained"></span>**self-explained** names in variables,
functions, classes, tests, structures, etc... are really <span
id="important"></span>**important**

If your refactoring introduces performance slow-downs, finish
refactoring first and worry about performance issues later.
