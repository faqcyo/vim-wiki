# Game Engine







# Renderer

This component abstracts the details of each Graphics API. For now i only have OpenGL, but in the future it should work with Vulkan as well.

With the renderer, the engine can:
  - [X] Create a VAO
  - [X] Create a VBO
  - [X] Create an EBO
  - [X] Create a Shader object
  - [ ] Create meshes
  - [ ] Render meshes
  - [ ] Render models
  - [ ] Manage textures
