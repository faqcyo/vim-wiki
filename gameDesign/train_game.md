# Train Game 

Each train will go on a track. The player is the manager of this railroad and has to make sure that each train doesn't crash with each other. Also, while the player progresses there will be more tracks generated, and the map will increase.

Take inspiration from "mini motorways" and that game that i played as a kid in which you tap cars to prevent them from crashing.
