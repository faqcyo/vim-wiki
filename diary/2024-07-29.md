# Graphics Engine

Today i will finish what was pending from yesterday (configuration of active textures) and also work with drawing with element buffer objects. 
I will also change the implementation of the OpenGLVertexArray.
  - [ ] Finish configuration of active textures
  - [ ] Fix element buffer objects

  - [X] Make the OpenGLVertexArray capable of storing only one VBO and only one EBO.
  - [X] Add a VBO and an EBO as parameters of the VAO constructor
  - [X] Bind and configure the data of VBO and EBO in VAO constructor
  - [X] Mark previous functions that used vectors of VBO as deprecated.

Today i've encountered a problem with the rendering of the triangle. What happened was that i had activated Depth Testing but the depth bit was not being cleared during the render. I've spent all day trying to find this problem. 

Also I downloaded apitrace which is a program that lets you trace the OpenGL api calls that the program makes. With this i've ensured that everything was being done correctly on the rendering part.
