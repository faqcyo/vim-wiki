# Working with the Graphics Engine

## Renderer

- Textures:
  I want the renderer to generate the textureID. I will use stb_image to load the image to RAM. I'm not sure if i want the renderer to depend on stb_image though. For now, i will not use any stb_image dependent code. I will load the image using the assetManager later. Once i have the image loaded and the textureID generated, the renderer should configure GL_TEXTURE_2D.
  - [X] Load image using stb_image from the assetManager.
  - [X] Generate a texture from the renderer.
  - [X] Configure the texture accordingly.
  - [ ] Recognize which texture to activate.
