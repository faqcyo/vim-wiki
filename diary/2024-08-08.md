  - [ ]  

# Game Engine

## Core

Since i will only want to have one instance of the AssetManager class, i can make some private variables static and define some inline static getter functions to access them.


## Batch Rendering

The VBO must be dynamic.
For multiple textures it is valid and recommended to use an array of textures (uniform sample2D) and have in the vertex attribute the index to that texture.
