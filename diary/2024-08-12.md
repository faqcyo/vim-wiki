# Train Game

**Tasks for today:**
  - [ ] Get a prototype for the gameplay


## Prototype

  - [ ] Create the railroad system
  - [ ] Make so that a train follows a certain path in a railroad.

**How will the railroad system work?**

1. I don't want hard curves. The curves should have a length of at least three tiles.
2. The delivery points must be connected to a railroad.
3. There must be some separation between delivery points. (Maybe not in the future?)
4. Dead ends doesn't exist.


Another design decision:
  Maybe let the user decide where to put the railroads. Though this will let the user stop time. But this will allow the player to solve deadlock situations between the trains.
  
  
**Implementation details:**

First i want to determine the available tiles in the map.

In the prototype case the tiles size is of 16x16
