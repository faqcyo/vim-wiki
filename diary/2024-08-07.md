## Batch Renderer

First of all some definitions:

* A batch refers to one or more meshes that could have been rendered with separate rendering commands. However, in order to improve performance, you use techniques to allow them all to be rendered with the same rendering command.
* Batching is the process of taking a sequence of meshes and making it possible to render them as a batch. Instanced rendering is one form of batch rendering, each instance is a separate "mesh", but you are rendering lots of them with one rendering call. They use their instance count to fetch their pre-instance state data.
