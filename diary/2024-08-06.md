# Game Engine

## Renderer

Tasks for today:
  - [ ] Refactor the code for the renderer

What i'm planning for the refactoring of the code is the following:
  - I want to keep the API specific code as it is now
  - I don't want to make a separate renderer for 2D and 3D.
  - The renderer should be the one that converts CPU data to GPU data. I don't want any part of my non renderer code to be creating VAOs or VBOs as it is now.
  - In internal/renderer/* i will have mostly abstract classes that the API/* will implement.

## Renderer 2D

Tasks for today:
  - [ ] Draw a quad
  - [ ] Draw a textured quad
  - [ ]  

## Batch Renderer

For the 2D and 3D renderer i will need a batch renderer. This type of renderer will be incorporated to the renderer. 

**Batch Rendering for 2D**:

Imagine a 2D platformer level, where there are a bunch of tiles. Each tile is a quad thats rendered by the renderer. If i wouldn't use a batch renderer there would be a bunch of draw calls to the GPU. 

I want to prevent this situation by using a batch rendering technique:
