# Graphics Engine

Continuing with the build system and project structure.
  - [X] Finish the build system with cmake



## Project Structure

I was thinking of having public everything instead renderer specific code. For this i would have the following structure inside the include directory
  - engine
    - assetManager
    - events
    - core
and i will have another directory called internal which will have those private headers:
  - intenal
    - renderer
    - API

Then the final project structure will be:

  - GraphicsEngine
    - include
      - engine
        - assetManager
        - events
        - core
    - internal
      - renderer
      - API
    - src
      - assetManager
      - events
      - core
      - renderer
      - API
      - main.cpp
    - assets (Maybe i will move this in the future to the Game/App
      - shaders
      - textures
      - models
    - build
    - lib (Third party libraries)
    - CMakeLists.txt
