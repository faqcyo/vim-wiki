# Graphics Engine

Tasks for today:
  - [X] Finish Events
  - [X] Finish loading models
  - [X] Finish the camera system


## Events

I will come back to this problem later. For now i will implement it using std::function.

```
typedef std::function<void(SDL_EventType, const SDL_Event&)> eventHandlerType;

Event::EventHandler {
  eventHandlerType func;
  bool valid;
}

eventHandler->func = std::bind(&Engine::onKeyDown, this, std::placeholders::_1, std::placeholders::_2);
```

I will need a reference to the EventHandler structure in every class where i want to manage some events.

## Camera

I want some smooth movement. For this i have to implement a function that handles input from user. Whenever the user holds some key, its state changes. I can do this inside the EventHandler class maybe. I can have a map with the keys.
